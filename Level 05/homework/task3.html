         <h3>little advice for those who need it</h3>
         <p>i just wanna give yall a little advice just dont ever lie to anyone especially your parents yea you might et away with it once or twice but youll get caught eventually and it will hurt the person you lied to they will lose all trust in your words and now they wont be able to belive anything you say.<br> you might ask how i know this? cuz ive experienced it i lied to my dad many times when i realized i was being stupid it was too late now my parents dont trust my words i dont blamed them tho they didnt deserve what i did.<br> just make sure before doing something you think about how it would make people feel how your loved ones will react how your friends will react just dont do anything stupid cuz it will be too late when youll realize what you have done.<br> why am i writing this? its because i dont want others to experience the pain of guilt it may not sound so bad bad it is<br> when i looked at my fathers face after i lied to him he said to me "you did same as stabbing me in the back" when i heard those words i froze my heart melted i couldnt bear the guilt in my heart i apoligized to him and knowing i didnt deserve forgivness i walked away got away from everyone and started thinking just how stupid i was i know im not the only one whos felt like this but i dont want someone else to experience it cuz it just makes you feel awful</p>
